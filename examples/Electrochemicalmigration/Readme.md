# Nernst-planck electrochemical migration in Solders joint
# Solution for concentration variable responsible for dendritic deposits
# The present example models a single species (ion) transport across the medium (from anode to cathode)
# Multiple species transport can be modeled by adding the number of kernels for each species (c_i).
