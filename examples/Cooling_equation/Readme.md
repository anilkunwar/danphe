#Cooling of Sn and SnAg solders upto their melting point temperatures
# The thermophysical properties of solders have no significant effect on the temperature for cross section length in the scale of microns.
# For cross section length greater than mm, there seems to exist temperature gradient along the vertical length of the solder
# Rather than using Cooling rate as Sink term, the convection heat transfer through the substrate with higher interfacial heat transfer coefficient is used here
# The ambient temperature is defined as a parsed function of time Tamb = f(t)
# Test code
# cheers
