#Cooling of Sn and SnAg solders upto their melting point temperatures
# Rather than using Cooling rate as Sink term, the convection heat transfer through the substrate with higher interfacial heat 
# transfer coefficient is used here
# The ambient temperature is defined as a parsed function of time Tamb = f(t)
# Test code
# cheers
