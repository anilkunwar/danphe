#Cooling of Sn and SnAg solders upto their melting point temperatures
# The literature for this example can be found in the article "Effect of cooling condition and Ag on the growth of
# intermetallic compounds in Sn-based solder joints" submitted to the journal "Applied Physics A"((DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00339-016-0543-4).
# The thermophysical properties of solders have no significant effect on the temperature for cross section length in the scale of microns.
# For cross section length greater than mm, there seems to exist temperature gradient along the vertical length of the solder
# Rather than using Cooling rate as Sink term, the convection heat transfer through the substrate with higher interfacial heat transfer coefficient is used here
# The ambient temperature is defined as a parsed function of time Tamb = f(t)
# Test code
# cheers
